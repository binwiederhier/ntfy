production problem with a few over-users that resulted in Firebase quota problems (only applying to the over-users).

On top of that, we updated the Firebase SDK and are now building the release in GitHub Actions. We've also got two
more translations: Chinese/Simplified and Dutch.

* Advanced logging, with different log levels and hot reloading of the log level ([#284](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/284))

**Bugs**:

* Respect Firebase "quota exceeded" response for topics, block Firebase publishing for user for 10min ([#289](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/289))

## ntfy iOS app v1.1
Released May 31, 2022

In this release of the iOS app, we add message priorities (mapped to iOS interruption levels), tags and emojis,
action buttons to open websites or perform HTTP requests (in the notification and the detail view), a custom click
action when the notification is tapped, and various other fixes.

It also adds support for self-hosted servers (albeit not supporting auth yet). The self-hosted server needs to be
configured to forward poll requests to upstream ntfy.sh for push notifications to work (see [iOS push notifications](https://ntfy.sh/docs/config/#ios-instant-notifications)
for details).

**Features:**

* [Message priority](https://ntfy.sh/docs/publish/#message-priority) support (no ticket)
* [Tags/emojis](https://ntfy.sh/docs/publish/#tags-emojis) support (no ticket)
* [Action buttons](https://ntfy.sh/docs/publish/#action-buttons) support (no ticket)
* [Click action](https://ntfy.sh/docs/publish/#click-action) support (no ticket)
* Open topic when notification clicked (no ticket)
* Notification now makes a sound and vibrates (no ticket)
* Cancel notifications when navigating to topic (no ticket)
* iOS 14.0 support (no ticket, [PR#1](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy-ios/pull/1), thanks to [@callum-99](https://github.com/callum-99))

**Bug fixes:**

* iOS UI not always updating properly ([#267](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/267))

## ntfy server v1.24.0
Released May 28, 2022

This release of the ntfy server brings supporting features for the ntfy iOS app. Most importantly, it
enables support for self-hosted servers in combination with the iOS app. This is to overcome the restrictive
Apple development environment.

**Features:**

* Regularly send Firebase keepalive messages to ~poll topic to support self-hosted servers (no ticket)
* Add subscribe filter to query exact messages by ID (no ticket)
* Support for `poll_request` messages to support [iOS push notifications](https://ntfy.sh/docs/config/#ios-instant-notifications) for self-hosted servers (no ticket)

**Bug fixes:**

* Support emails without `Content-Type` ([#265](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/265), thanks to [@dmbonsall](https://github.com/dmbonsall))

**Additional translations:**

* Italian (thanks to [@Genio2003](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/Genio2003/))

## ntfy iOS app v1.0
Released May 25, 2022

This is the first version of the ntfy iOS app. It supports only ntfy.sh (no selfhosted servers) and only messages + title
(no priority, tags, attachments, ...). I'll rapidly add (hopefully) most of the other ntfy features, and then I'll focus
on self-hosted servers.

The app is now available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347).

**Tickets:**

* iOS app ([#4](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/4), see also: [TestFlight summary](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/4#issuecomment-1133767150))

**Thanks:**

* Thank you to all the testers who tried out the app. You guys gave me the confidence that it's ready to release (albeit with
  some known issues which will be addressed in follow-up releases).

## ntfy server v1.23.0

it adds support for APNs, the iOS messaging service. This is needed for the (soon to be released) iOS app.

**Features:**
