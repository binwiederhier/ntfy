# Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

## Isn't this like ...?

Who knows. I didn't do a lot of research before making this. It was fun making it.

## Can I use this in my app? Will it stay free?

Yes. As long as you don't abuse it, it'll be available and free of charge. While I will always allow usage of the ntfy.sh
server without signup and free of charge, I may also offer paid plans in the future.

## What are the uptime guarantees?

Best effort.

ntfy currently runs on a single DigitalOcean droplet, without any scale out strategy or redundancies. When the time comes,
I'll add scale out features, but for now it is what it is.

In the first year of its life, and to this day (Dec'22), ntfy had **no outages** that I can remember. Other than short
blips and some HTTP 500 spikes, it has been rock solid.

There is a [status page](https://ntfy.statuspage.io/) which is updated based on some automated checks via the amazingly
awesome [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/) (_no affiliation, just a fan_).

## What happens if there are multiple subscribers to the same topic?

As per usual with pub-sub, all subscribers receive notifications if they are subscribed to a topic.

## Will you know what topics exist, can you spy on me?

If you don't trust me or your messages are sensitive, run your own server. It's open source.
That said, the logs do contain topic names and IP addresses, but I don't use them for anything other than
troubleshooting and rate limiting. Messages are cached for the duration configured in `server.yml` (12h by default)
to facilitate service restarts, message polling and to overcome client network disruptions.

## Can I self-host it?

Yes. The server (including this Web UI) can be self-hosted, and the Android/iOS app supports adding topics from
your own server as well. Check out the [install instructions](install.md).

## Is Firebase used?

In addition to caching messages locally and delivering them to long-polling subscribers, all messages are also
published to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) (if `FirebaseKeyFile` is set, which it is on ntfy.sh). This
is to facilitate notifications on Android.

If you do not care for Firebase, I suggest you install the [F-Droid version](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.heckel.ntfy/)
of the app and [self-host your own ntfy server](install.md).

## How much battery does the Android app use?

If you use the ntfy.sh server, and you don't use the [instant delivery](subscribe/phone.md#instant-delivery) feature,
the Android/iOS app uses no additional battery, since Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is used. If you use your own server,
or you use _instant delivery_ (Android only), or install from F-droid ([which does not support FCM](https://f-droid.org/docs/Inclusion_Policy/)),
the app has to maintain a constant connection to the server, which consumes about 0-1% of battery in 17h of use (on my phone).
There has been a ton of testing and improvement around this. I think it's pretty decent now.

## Paid plans? I thought it was open source?

All of ntfy will remain open source, with a free software license (Apache 2.0 and GPLv2). If you'd like to self-host, you
can (and should do that). The paid plans I am offering are for people that do not want to self-host, and/or need higher
limits.

## What is instant delivery?

[Instant delivery](subscribe/phone.md#instant-delivery) is a feature in the Android app. If turned on, the app maintains a constant connection to the
server and listens for incoming notifications. This consumes additional battery (see above),
but delivers notifications instantly.

## Can you implement feature X?

Yes, maybe. Check out [existing GitHub issues](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues) to see if somebody else had
the same idea before you, or file a new issue. I'll likely get back to you within a few days.

## I'm having issues with iOS, can you help? The iOS app is behind compared to the Android app, can you fix that?

The iOS is very bare bones and quite frankly a little buggy. I wanted to get something out the door to make the iOS users
happy, but halfway through I got frustrated with iOS development and paused development. I will eventually get back to
it, or hopefully, somebody else will come along and help out. Please review the [known issues](known-issues.md) for details.

## Can I disable the web app? Can I protect it with a login screen?

The web app is a static website without a backend (other than the ntfy API). All data is stored locally in the browser
cache and local storage. That means it does not need to be protected with a login screen, and it poses no additional
security risk. So technically, it does not need to be disabled.

However, if you still want to disable it, you can do so with the `web-root: disable` option in the `server.yml` file.

Think of the ntfy web app like an Android/iOS app. It is freely available and accessible to anyone, yet useless without
a proper backend. So as long as you secure your backend with ACLs, exposing the ntfy web app to the Internet is harmless.

## Where can I donate?

I have just very recently started accepting donations via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier).
I would be humbled if you helped me carry the server and developer account costs. Even small donations are very much
appreciated.
