# ntfy server config file
#
# Please refer to the documentation at https://ntfy.sh/docs/config/ for details.
# All options also support underscores (_) instead of dashes (-) to comply with the YAML spec.

# Public facing base URL of the service (e.g. https://ntfy.sh or https://ntfy.example.com)
#
# This setting is required for any of the following features:
# - attachments (to return a download URL)
# - e-mail sending (for the topic URL in the email footer)
# - iOS push notifications for self-hosted servers (to calculate the Firebase poll_request topic)
# - Matrix Push Gateway (to validate that the pushkey is correct)
#
# base-url:

# Listen address for the HTTP & HTTPS web server. If "listen-https" is set, you must also
# set "key-file" and "cert-file". Format: [<ip>]:<port>, e.g. "1.2.3.4:8080".
#
# To listen on all interfaces, you may omit the IP address, e.g. ":443".
# To disable HTTP, set "listen-http" to "-".
#
# listen-http: ":80"
# listen-https:

# Listen on a Unix socket, e.g. /var/lib/ntfy/ntfy.sock
# This can be useful to avoid port issues on local systems, and to simplify permissions.
#
# listen-unix: <socket-path>
# listen-unix-mode: <linux permissions, e.g. 0700>

# Path to the private key & cert file for the HTTPS web server. Not used if "listen-https" is not set.
#
# key-file: <filename>
# cert-file: <filename>

# If set, also publish messages to a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) topic for your app.
# This is optional and only required to save battery when using the Android app.
#
# firebase-key-file: <filename>

# If "cache-file" is set, messages are cached in a local SQLite database instead of only in-memory.
# This allows for service restarts without losing messages in support of the since= parameter.
#
# The "cache-duration" parameter defines the duration for which messages will be buffered
# before they are deleted. This is required to support the "since=..." and "poll=1" parameter.
# To disable the cache entirely (on-disk/in-memory), set "cache-duration" to 0.
# The cache file is created automatically, provided that the correct permissions are set.
#
# The "cache-startup-queries" parameter allows you to run commands when the database is initialized,
# e.g. to enable WAL mode (see https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2020/sqlite-performance-tuning/)).
# Example:
#    cache-startup-queries: |
#       pragma journal_mode = WAL;
#       pragma synchronous = normal;
#       pragma temp_store = memory;
#       pragma busy_timeout = 15000;
#       vacuum;
#
# The "cache-batch-size" and "cache-batch-timeout" parameter allow enabling async batch writing
# of messages. If set, messages will be queued and written to the database in batches of the given
# size, or after the given timeout. This is only required for high volume servers.
#
# Debian/RPM package users:
#   Use /var/cache/ntfy/cache.db as cache file to avoid permission issues. The package
#   creates this folder for you.
#
# Check your permissions:
#   If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this cache file is owned by the
#   ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.
#
# cache-file: <filename>
# cache-duration: "12h"
# cache-startup-queries:
# cache-batch-size: 0
# cache-batch-timeout: "0ms"

# If set, access to the ntfy server and API can be controlled on a granular level using
# the 'ntfy user' and 'ntfy access' commands. See the --help pages for details, or check the docs.
#
# - auth-file is the SQLite user/access database; it is created automatically if it doesn't already exist
# - auth-default-access defines the default/fallback access if no access control entry is found; it can be
#   set to "read-write" (default), "read-only", "write-only" or "deny-all".
# - auth-startup-queries allows you to run commands when the database is initialized, e.g. to enable
#   WAL mode. This is similar to cache-startup-queries. See above for details.
#
# Debian/RPM package users:
#   Use /var/lib/ntfy/user.db as user database to avoid permission issues. The package
#   creates this folder for you.
#
# Check your permissions:
#   If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this user database file is owned by the
#   ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.
#
# auth-file: <filename>
# auth-default-access: "read-write"
# auth-startup-queries:

# If set, the X-Forwarded-For header is used to determine the visitor IP address
# instead of the remote address of the connection.
#
# WARNING: If you are behind a proxy, you must set this, otherwise all visitors are rate limited
#          as if they are one.
#
# behind-proxy: false

# If enabled, clients can attach files to notifications as attachments. Minimum settings to enable attachments
# are "attachment-cache-dir" and "base-url".
#
# - attachment-cache-dir is the cache directory for attached files
# - attachment-total-size-limit is the limit of the on-disk attachment cache directory (total size)
# - attachment-file-size-limit is the per-file attachment size limit (e.g. 300k, 2M, 100M)
# - attachment-expiry-duration is the duration after which uploaded attachments will be deleted (e.g. 3h, 20h)
#
# attachment-cache-dir:
# attachment-total-size-limit: "5G"
# attachment-file-size-limit: "15M"
# attachment-expiry-duration: "3h"

# If enabled, allow outgoing e-mail notifications via the 'X-Email' header. If this header is set,
# messages will additionally be sent out as e-mail using an external SMTP server.
#
# As of today, only SMTP servers with plain text auth (or no auth at all), and STARTLS are supported.
# Please also refer to the rate limiting settings below (visitor-email-limit-burst & visitor-email-limit-burst).
#
# - smtp-sender-addr is the hostname:port of the SMTP server
# - smtp-sender-from is the e-mail address of the sender
# - smtp-sender-user/smtp-sender-pass are the username and password of the SMTP user (leave blank for no auth)
#
# smtp-sender-addr:
# smtp-sender-from:
# smtp-sender-user:
# smtp-sender-pass:

# If enabled, ntfy will launch a lightweight SMTP server for incoming messages. Once configured, users can send
# emails to a topic e-mail address to publish messages to a topic.
#
# - smtp-server-listen defines the IP address and port the SMTP server will listen on, e.g. :25 or 1.2.3.4:25
# - smtp-server-domain is the e-mail domain, e.g. ntfy.sh
# - smtp-server-addr-prefix is an optional prefix for the e-mail addresses to prevent spam. If set to "ntfy-",
#   for instance, only e-mails to ntfy-$topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted. If this is not set, all emails to
#   $topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted (which may obviously be a spam problem).
#
# smtp-server-listen:
# smtp-server-domain:
# smtp-server-addr-prefix:

# Web Push support (background notifications for browsers)
#
# If enabled, allows ntfy to receive push notifications, even when the ntfy web app is closed. When enabled, users
# can enable background notifications in the web app. Once enabled, ntfy will forward published messages to the push
# endpoint, which will then forward it to the browser.
#
# You must configure web-push-public/private key, web-push-file, and web-push-email-address below to enable Web Push.
# Run "ntfy webpush keys" to generate the keys.
#
# - web-push-public-key is the generated VAPID public key, e.g. AA1234BBCCddvveekaabcdfqwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm1234567890
# - web-push-private-key is the generated VAPID private key, e.g. AA2BB1234567890abcdefzxcvbnm1234567890
# - web-push-file is a database file to keep track of browser subscription endpoints, e.g. `/var/cache/ntfy/webpush.db`
# - web-push-email-address is the admin email address send to the push provider, e.g. `sysadmin@example.com`
# - web-push-startup-queries is an optional list of queries to run on startup`
#
# web-push-public-key:
# web-push-private-key:

# If enabled, ntfy can perform voice calls via Twilio via the "X-Call" header.
#
# - twilio-account is the Twilio account SID, e.g. AC12345beefbeef67890beefbeef122586
# - twilio-auth-token is the Twilio auth token, e.g. affebeef258625862586258625862586
# - twilio-phone-number is the outgoing phone number you purchased, e.g. +18775132586

# Interval in which keepalive messages are sent to the client. This is to prevent
# intermediaries closing the connection for inactivity.
#
# Note that the Android app has a hardcoded timeout at 77s, so it should be less than that.

# keepalive-interval: "45s"

# Interval in which the manager prunes old messages, deletes topics
# and prints the stats.
#
# manager-interval: "1m"

# Defines topic names that are not allowed, because they are otherwise used. There are a few default topics

# Various feature flags used to control the web app, and API access, mainly around user and
# account management.
#
# - enable-signup allows users to sign up via the web app, or API

# Server URL of a Firebase/APNS-connected ntfy server (likely "https://ntfy.sh").
#
# iOS users:
#   If you use the iOS ntfy app, you MUST configure this to receive timely notifications. You'll like want this:
#   upstream-base-url: "https://ntfy.sh"
#
# If set, all incoming messages will publish a "poll_request" message to the configured upstream server, containing
# the message ID of the original message, instructing the iOS app to poll this server for the actual message contents.
# This is to prevent the upstream server and Firebase/APNS from being able to read the message.
#
# - upstream-base-url is the base URL of the upstream server. Should be "https://ntfy.sh".
# - upstream-access-token is the token used to authenticate with the upstream server. This is only required
#   if you exceed the upstream rate limits, or the uptream server requires authentication.
#
# upstream-base-url:
# upstream-access-token:

# Configures message-specific limits
#
# - message-size-limit defines the max size of a message body. Please note message sizes >4K are NOT RECOMMENDED,
#   and largely untested. If FCM and/or APNS is used, the limit should stay 4K, because their limits are around that size.
#   If you increase this size limit regardless, FCM and APNS will NOT work for large messages.
# - message-delay-limit defines the max delay of a message when using the "Delay" header.
#
# message-size-limit: "4k"
# message-delay-limit: "3d"

# Rate limiting: Total number of topics before the server rejects new topics.
#
# global-topic-limit: 15000

# Rate limiting: Number of subscriptions per visitor (IP address)
#
# visitor-subscription-limit: 30

# Rate limiting: Allowed GET/PUT/POST requests per second, per visitor:
# - visitor-request-limit-burst is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has
# - visitor-request-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
# - visitor-request-limit-exempt-hosts is a comma-separated list of hostnames, IPs or CIDRs to be
#   exempt from request rate limiting. Hostnames are resolved at the time the server is started.
#   Example: "1.2.3.4,ntfy.example.com,8.7.6.0/24"
#
# visitor-request-limit-burst: 60
# visitor-request-limit-replenish: "5s"
# visitor-request-limit-exempt-hosts: ""

# Rate limiting: Hard daily limit of messages per visitor and day. The limit is reset
# every day at midnight UTC. If the limit is not set (or set to zero), the request
# limit (see above) governs the upper limit.
#
# visitor-message-daily-limit: 0

# Rate limiting: Allowed emails per visitor:
# - visitor-email-limit-burst is the initial bucket of emails each visitor has
# - visitor-email-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
#
# visitor-email-limit-burst: 16
# visitor-email-limit-replenish: "1h"

# Rate limiting: Attachment size and bandwidth limits per visitor:
# - visitor-attachment-total-size-limit is the total storage limit used for attachments per visitor
# - visitor-attachment-daily-bandwidth-limit is the total daily attachment download/upload traffic limit per visitor
#
# visitor-attachment-total-size-limit: "100M"
# visitor-attachment-daily-bandwidth-limit: "500M"

# Rate limiting: Enable subscriber-based rate limiting (mostly used for UnifiedPush)
#
# If subscriber-based rate limiting is enabled, messages published on UnifiedPush topics** (topics starting with "up")
# will be counted towards the "rate visitor" of the topic. A "rate visitor" is the first subscriber to the topic.
#
# Once enabled, a client subscribing to UnifiedPush topics via HTTP stream, or websockets, will be automatically registered as
# a "rate visitor", i.e. the visitor whose rate limits will be used when publishing on this topic. Note that setting the rate visitor
# requires **read-write permission** on the topic.
#
# If this setting is enabled, publishing to UnifiedPush topics will lead to a HTTP 507 response if
# no "rate visitor" has been previously registered. This is to avoid burning the publisher's "visitor-message-daily-limit".
#
# visitor-subscriber-rate-limiting: false

# Payments integration via Stripe
#
# - stripe-secret-key is the key used for the Stripe API communication. Setting this values
#   enables payments in the ntfy web app (e.g. Upgrade dialog). See https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
# - stripe-webhook-key is the key required to validate the authenticity of incoming webhooks from Stripe.
#   Webhooks are essential up keep the local database in sync with the payment provider. See https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks.
# - billing-contact is an email address or website displayed in the "Upgrade tier" dialog to let people reach
#   out with billing questions. If unset, nothing will be displayed.
#
# stripe-secret-key:
# stripe-webhook-key:
# billing-contact:

# Metrics
#
# ntfy can expose Prometheus-style metrics via a /metrics endpoint, or on a dedicated listen IP/port.
# Metrics may be considered sensitive information, so before you enable them, be sure you know what you are
# doing, and/or secure access to the endpoint in your reverse proxy.
#
# - enable-metrics enables the /metrics endpoint for the default ntfy server (i.e. HTTP, HTTPS and/or Unix socket)
# - metrics-listen-http exposes the metrics endpoint via a dedicated [IP]:port. If set, this option implicitly
#   enables metrics as well, e.g. "10.0.1.1:9090" or ":9090"
#
# enable-metrics: false
# metrics-listen-http:

# Profiling
#
# ntfy can expose Go's net/http/pprof endpoints to support profiling of the ntfy server. If enabled, ntfy will listen
# on a dedicated listen IP/port, which can be accessed via the web browser on http://<ip>:<port>/debug/pprof/.
# This can be helpful to expose bottlenecks, and visualize call flows. See https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof for details.
#
# profile-listen-http:

# Logging options
#
# By default, ntfy logs to the console (stderr), with an "info" log level, and in a human-readable text format.
# ntfy supports five different log levels, can also write to a file, log as JSON, and even supports granular
# log level overrides for easier debugging. Some options (log-level and log-level-overrides) can be hot reloaded
# by calling "kill -HUP $pid" or "systemctl reload ntfy".
#
# - log-format defines the output format, can be "text" (default) or "json"
# - log-file is a filename to write logs to. If this is not set, ntfy logs to stderr.
# - log-level defines the default log level, can be one of "trace", "debug", "info" (default), "warn" or "error".
#   Be aware that "debug" (and particularly "trace") can be VERY CHATTY. Only turn them on briefly for debugging purposes.
# - log-level-overrides lets you override the log level if certain fields match. This is incredibly powerful
#   for debugging certain parts of the system (e.g. only the account management, or only a certain visitor).
#   This is an array of strings in the format:
#      - "field=value -> level" to match a value exactly, e.g. "tag=manager -> trace"
#      - "field -> level" to match any value, e.g. "time_taken_ms -> debug"
#   Warning: Using log-level-overrides has a performance penalty. Only use it for temporary debugging.
#
# Check your permissions:
#   If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this log file is owned by the
#   ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.
#
# Example (good for production):
#   log-level: info
#   log-format: json
#   log-file: /var/log/ntfy.log
#
# Example level overrides (for debugging, only use temporarily):
#   log-level-overrides:
#      - "tag=manager -> trace"
#      - "visitor_ip=1.2.3.4 -> debug"
#      - "time_taken_ms -> debug"
#
# log-level: info
# log-level-overrides:
# log-format: text
# log-file:
