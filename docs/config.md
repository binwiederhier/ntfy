# Configuring the ntfy server
The ntfy server can be configured in three ways: using a config file (typically at `/etc/ntfy/server.yml`, 
see [server.yml](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/blob/main/server/server.yml)), via command line arguments 
or using environment variables.

## Quick start
By default, simply running `ntfy serve` will start the server at port 80. No configuration needed. Batteries included ðŸ˜€. 
If everything works as it should, you'll see something like this:
```
$ ntfy serve
2021/11/30 19:59:08 Listening on :80
```

You can immediately start [publishing messages](publish.md), or subscribe via the [Android app](subscribe/phone.md),
[the web UI](subscribe/web.md), or simply via [curl or your favorite HTTP client](subscribe/api.md). To configure 
the server further, check out the [config options table](#config-options) or simply type `ntfy serve --help` to
get a list of [command line options](#command-line-options).

## Example config
!!! info
    Definitely check out the **[server.yml](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/blob/main/server/server.yml)** file.
    It contains examples and detailed descriptions of all the settings.

The most basic settings are `base-url` (the external URL of the ntfy server), the HTTP/HTTPS listen address (`listen-http`
and `listen-https`), and socket path (`listen-unix`). All the other things are additional features.

Here are a few working sample configs:

=== "server.yml (HTTP-only, with cache + attachments)"
    ``` yaml
    base-url: "http://ntfy.example.com"
    cache-file: "/var/cache/ntfy/cache.db"
    attachment-cache-dir: "/var/cache/ntfy/attachments"
    ```

=== "server.yml (HTTP+HTTPS, with cache + attachments)"
    ``` yaml
    base-url: "http://ntfy.example.com"
    listen-http: ":80"
    listen-https: ":443"
    key-file: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/ntfy.example.com.key"
    cert-file: "/etc/letsencrypt/live/ntfy.example.com.crt"
    cache-file: "/var/cache/ntfy/cache.db"
    attachment-cache-dir: "/var/cache/ntfy/attachments"
    ```

=== "server.yml (ntfy.sh config)"
    ``` yaml
    # All the things: Behind a proxy, Firebase, cache, attachments, 
    # SMTP publishing & receiving

    base-url: "https://ntfy.sh"
    listen-http: "127.0.0.1:2586"
    firebase-key-file: "/etc/ntfy/firebase.json"
    cache-file: "/var/cache/ntfy/cache.db"
    behind-proxy: true
    attachment-cache-dir: "/var/cache/ntfy/attachments"
    smtp-sender-addr: "email-smtp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:587"
    smtp-sender-user: "AKIDEADBEEFAFFE12345"
    smtp-sender-pass: "Abd13Kf+sfAk2DzifjafldkThisIsNotARealKeyOMG."
    smtp-sender-from: "ntfy@ntfy.sh"
    smtp-server-listen: ":25"
    smtp-server-domain: "ntfy.sh"
    smtp-server-addr-prefix: "ntfy-"
    keepalive-interval: "45s"
    ```

## Message cache
If desired, ntfy can temporarily keep notifications in an in-memory or an on-disk cache. Caching messages for a short period
of time is important to allow [phones](subscribe/phone.md) and other devices with brittle Internet connections to be able to retrieve
notifications that they may have missed. 

By default, ntfy keeps messages **in-memory for 12 hours**, which means that **cached messages do not survive an application
restart**. You can override this behavior using the following config settings:

* `cache-file`: if set, ntfy will store messages in a SQLite based cache (default is empty, which means in-memory cache).
  **This is required if you'd like messages to be retained across restarts**.
* `cache-duration`: defines the duration for which messages are stored in the cache (default is `12h`). 

You can also entirely disable the cache by setting `cache-duration` to `0`. When the cache is disabled, messages are only
passed on to the connected subscribers, but never stored on disk or even kept in memory longer than is needed to forward
the message to the subscribers.

Subscribers can retrieve cached messaging using the [`poll=1` parameter](subscribe/api.md#poll-for-messages), as well as the
[`since=` parameter](subscribe/api.md#fetch-cached-messages).

## Attachments
If desired, you may allow users to upload and [attach files to notifications](publish.md#attachments). To enable
this feature, you have to simply configure an attachment cache directory and a base URL (`attachment-cache-dir`, `base-url`). 
Once these options are set and the directory is writable by the server user, you can upload attachments via PUT.

By default, attachments are stored in the disk-cache **for only 3 hours**. The main reason for this is to avoid legal issues
and such when hosting user controlled content. Typically, this is more than enough time for the user (or the auto download 
feature) to download the file. The following config options are relevant to attachments:

* `base-url` is the root URL for the ntfy server; this is needed for the generated attachment URLs
* `attachment-cache-dir` is the cache directory for attached files
* `attachment-total-size-limit` is the size limit of the on-disk attachment cache (default: 5G)
* `attachment-file-size-limit` is the per-file attachment size limit (e.g. 300k, 2M, 100M, default: 15M)
* `attachment-expiry-duration` is the duration after which uploaded attachments will be deleted (e.g. 3h, 20h, default: 3h)

Here's an example config using mostly the defaults (except for the cache directory, which is empty by default): 

=== "/etc/ntfy/server.yml (minimal)"
    ``` yaml
    base-url: "https://ntfy.sh"
    attachment-cache-dir: "/var/cache/ntfy/attachments"
    ```

=== "/etc/ntfy/server.yml (all options)"
    ``` yaml
    base-url: "https://ntfy.sh"
    attachment-cache-dir: "/var/cache/ntfy/attachments"
    attachment-total-size-limit: "5G"
    attachment-file-size-limit: "15M"
    attachment-expiry-duration: "3h"
    visitor-attachment-total-size-limit: "100M"
    visitor-attachment-daily-bandwidth-limit: "500M"
    ```

Please also refer to the [rate limiting](#rate-limiting) settings below, specifically `visitor-attachment-total-size-limit`
and `visitor-attachment-daily-bandwidth-limit`. Setting these conservatively is necessary to avoid abuse.

## Access control
By default, the ntfy server is open for everyone, meaning **everyone can read and write to any topic** (this is how
ntfy.sh is configured). To restrict access to your own server, you can optionally configure authentication and authorization. 

ntfy's auth is implemented with a simple [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/)-based backend. It implements two roles 
(`user` and `admin`) and per-topic `read` and `write` permissions using an [access control list (ACL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access-control_list). 
Access control entries can be applied to users as well as the special everyone user (`*`), which represents anonymous API access. 

To set up auth, simply **configure the following two options**:

* `auth-file` is the user/access database; it is created automatically if it doesn't already exist; suggested 
  location `/var/lib/ntfy/user.db` (easiest if deb/rpm package is used)
* `auth-default-access` defines the default/fallback access if no access control entry is found; it can be
  set to `read-write` (default), `read-only`, `write-only` or `deny-all`.

Once configured, you can use the `ntfy user` command to [add or modify users](#users-and-roles), and the `ntfy access` command
lets you [modify the access control list](#access-control-list-acl) for specific users and topic patterns. Both of these 
commands **directly edit the auth database** (as defined in `auth-file`), so they only work on the server, and only if the user 
accessing them has the right permissions.

### Users and roles
The `ntfy user` command allows you to add/remove/change users in the ntfy user database, as well as change
passwords or roles (`user` or `admin`). In practice, you'll often just create one admin 
user with `ntfy user add --role=admin ...` and be done with all this (see [example below](#example-private-instance)).

**Roles:**

* Role `user` (default): Users with this role have no special permissions. Manage access using `ntfy access`
  (see [below](#access-control-list-acl)).
* Role `admin`: Users with this role can read/write to all topics. Granular access control is not necessary.

**Example commands** (type `ntfy user --help` or `ntfy user COMMAND --help` for more details):

```
ntfy user list                     # Shows list of users (alias: 'ntfy access')
ntfy user add phil                 # Add regular user phil  
ntfy user add --role=admin phil    # Add admin user phil
ntfy user del phil                 # Delete user phil
ntfy user change-pass phil         # Change password for user phil
ntfy user change-role phil admin   # Make user phil an admin
```

### Access control list (ACL)
The access control list (ACL) **manages access to topics for non-admin users, and for anonymous access (`everyone`/`*`)**.
Each entry represents the access permissions for a user to a specific topic or topic pattern. 

The ACL can be displayed or modified with the `ntfy access` command:

```
ntfy access                            # Shows access control list (alias: 'ntfy user list')
ntfy access USERNAME                   # Shows access control entries for USERNAME
ntfy access USERNAME TOPIC PERMISSION  # Allow/deny access for USERNAME to TOPIC
```

A `USERNAME` is an existing user, as created with `ntfy user add` (see [users and roles](#users-and-roles)), or the 
anonymous user `everyone` or `*`, which represents clients that access the API without username/password.

A `TOPIC` is either a specific topic name (e.g. `mytopic`, or `phil_alerts`), or a wildcard pattern that matches any
number of topics (e.g. `alerts_*` or `ben-*`). Only the wildcard character `*` is supported. It stands for zero to any 
number of characters.

A `PERMISSION` is any of the following supported permissions:

* `read-write` (alias: `rw`): Allows [publishing messages](publish.md) to the given topic, as well as 
  [subscribing](subscribe/api.md) and reading messages
* `read-only` (aliases: `read`, `ro`): Allows only subscribing and reading messages, but not publishing to the topic
* `write-only` (aliases: `write`, `wo`): Allows only publishing to the topic, but not subscribing to it
* `deny` (alias: `none`): Allows neither publishing nor subscribing to a topic 

**Example commands** (type `ntfy access --help` for more details):
```
ntfy access                        # Shows entire access control list
ntfy access phil                   # Shows access for user phil
ntfy access phil mytopic rw        # Allow read-write access to mytopic for user phil
ntfy access everyone mytopic rw    # Allow anonymous read-write access to mytopic
ntfy access everyone "up*" write   # Allow anonymous write-only access to topics "up..."
ntfy access --reset                # Reset entire access control list
ntfy access --reset phil           # Reset all access for user phil
ntfy access --reset phil mytopic   # Reset access for user phil and topic mytopic
```

**Example ACL:**
```
$ ntfy access
user phil (admin)
- read-write access to all topics (admin role)
user ben (user)
- read-write access to topic garagedoor
- read-write access to topic alerts*
- read-only access to topic furnace
user * (anonymous)
- read-only access to topic announcements
- read-only access to topic server-stats
- no access to any (other) topics (server config)
```

In this example, `phil` has the role `admin`, so he has read-write access to all topics (no ACL entries are necessary).
User `ben` has three topic-specific entries. He can read, but not write to topic `furnace`, and has read-write access
to topic `garagedoor` and all topics starting with the word `alerts` (wildcards). Clients that are not authenticated
(called `*`/`everyone`) only have read access to the `announcements` and `server-stats` topics.

### Example: Private instance
The easiest way to configure a private instance is to set `auth-default-access` to `deny-all` in the `server.yml`:

=== "/etc/ntfy/server.yml"
    ``` yaml
    auth-file: "/var/lib/ntfy/user.db"
    auth-default-access: "deny-all"
    ```

After that, simply create an `admin` user:

```
$ ntfy user add --role=admin phil
password: mypass
confirm: mypass
user phil added with role admin 
```

Once you've done that, you can publish and subscribe using [Basic Auth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) 
with the given username/password. Be sure to use HTTPS to avoid eavesdropping and exposing your password. Here's a simple example:

=== "Command line (curl)"
    ```
    curl \
        -u phil:mypass \
        -d "Look ma, with auth" \
        https://ntfy.example.com/mysecrets
    ```

=== "ntfy CLI"
    ```
    ntfy publish \
        -u phil:mypass \
        ntfy.example.com/mysecrets \
        "Look ma, with auth"
    ```

=== "HTTP"
    ``` http
    POST /mysecrets HTTP/1.1
    Host: ntfy.example.com
    Authorization: Basic cGhpbDpteXBhc3M=

    Look ma, with auth
    ```

=== "JavaScript"
    ``` javascript
    fetch('https://ntfy.example.com/mysecrets', {
        method: 'POST', // PUT works too
        body: 'Look ma, with auth',
        headers: {
            'Authorization': 'Basic cGhpbDpteXBhc3M='
        }
    })
    ```

=== "Go"
    ``` go
    req, _ := http.NewRequest("POST", "https://ntfy.example.com/mysecrets",
        strings.NewReader("Look ma, with auth"))
    req.Header.Set("Authorization", "Basic cGhpbDpteXBhc3M=")
    http.DefaultClient.Do(req)
    ```

=== "Python"
    ``` python
    requests.post("https://ntfy.example.com/mysecrets",
        data="Look ma, with auth",
        headers={
            "Authorization": "Basic cGhpbDpteXBhc3M="
        })
    ```

=== "PHP"
    ``` php-inline
    file_get_contents('https://ntfy.example.com/mysecrets', false, stream_context_create([
        'http' => [
            'method' => 'POST', // PUT also works
            'header' => 
                'Content-Type: text/plain\r\n' .
                'Authorization: Basic cGhpbDpteXBhc3M=',
            'content' => 'Look ma, with auth'
        ]
    ]));
    ```

## E-mail notifications
To allow forwarding messages via e-mail, you can configure an **SMTP server for outgoing messages**. Once configured, 
you can set the `X-Email` header to [send messages via e-mail](publish.md#e-mail-notifications) (e.g. 
`curl -d "hi there" -H "X-Email: phil@example.com" ntfy.sh/mytopic`).

As of today, only SMTP servers with PLAIN auth and STARTLS are supported. To enable e-mail sending, you must set the 
following settings:

* `base-url` is the root URL for the ntfy server; this is needed for e-mail footer
* `smtp-sender-addr` is the hostname:port of the SMTP server
* `smtp-sender-user` and `smtp-sender-pass` are the username and password of the SMTP user
* `smtp-sender-from` is the e-mail address of the sender

Here's an example config using [Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) for outgoing mail (this is how it is 
configured for `ntfy.sh`):

=== "/etc/ntfy/server.yml"
    ``` yaml
    base-url: "https://ntfy.sh"
    smtp-sender-addr: "email-smtp.us-east-2.amazonaws.com:587"
    smtp-sender-user: "AKIDEADBEEFAFFE12345"
    smtp-sender-pass: "Abd13Kf+sfAk2DzifjafldkThisIsNotARealKeyOMG."
    smtp-sender-from: "ntfy@ntfy.sh"
    ```

Please also refer to the [rate limiting](#rate-limiting) settings below, specifically `visitor-email-limit-burst` 
and `visitor-email-limit-burst`. Setting these conservatively is necessary to avoid abuse.

## E-mail publishing
To allow publishing messages via e-mail, ntfy can run a lightweight **SMTP server for incoming messages**. Once configured, 
users can [send emails to a topic e-mail address](publish.md#e-mail-publishing) (e.g. `mytopic@ntfy.sh` or 
`myprefix-mytopic@ntfy.sh`) to publish messages to a topic. This is useful for e-mail based integrations such as for 
statuspage.io (though these days most services also support webhooks and HTTP calls).

To configure the SMTP server, you must at least set `smtp-server-listen` and `smtp-server-domain`:

* `smtp-server-listen` defines the IP address and port the SMTP server will listen on, e.g. `:25` or `1.2.3.4:25`
* `smtp-server-domain` is the e-mail domain, e.g. `ntfy.sh` (must be identical to MX record, see below)
* `smtp-server-addr-prefix` is an optional prefix for the e-mail addresses to prevent spam. If set to `ntfy-`, for instance,
  only e-mails to `ntfy-$topic@ntfy.sh` will be accepted. If this is not set, all emails to `$topic@ntfy.sh` will be
  accepted (which may obviously be a spam problem).

Here's an example config (this is how it is configured for `ntfy.sh`):

=== "/etc/ntfy/server.yml"
    ``` yaml
    smtp-server-listen: ":25"
    smtp-server-domain: "ntfy.sh"
    smtp-server-addr-prefix: "ntfy-"
    ```

In addition to configuring the ntfy server, you have to create two DNS records (an [MX record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MX_record) 
and a corresponding A record), so incoming mail will find its way to your server. Here's an example of how `ntfy.sh` is 
configured (in [Amazon Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/)):

<figure markdown>
  ![DNS records for incoming mail](static/img/screenshot-email-publishing-dns.png){ width=600 }
  <figcaption>DNS records for incoming mail</figcaption>
</figure>

You can check if everything is working correctly by sending an email as raw SMTP via `nc`. Create a text file, e.g. 
`email.txt`

```
EHLO example.com
MAIL FROM: phil@example.com
RCPT TO: ntfy-mytopic@ntfy.sh
DATA
Subject: Email for you
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="UTF-8"

Hello from ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
.
```

And then send the mail via `nc` like this. If you see any lines starting with `451`, those are errors from the 
ntfy server. Read them carefully.

```
$ cat email.txt | nc -N ntfy.sh 25
220 ntfy.sh ESMTP Service Ready
250-Hello example.com
...
250 2.0.0 Roger, accepting mail from <phil@example.com>
250 2.0.0 I'll make sure <ntfy-mytopic@ntfy.sh> gets this
```

As for the DNS setup, be sure to verify that `dig MX` and `dig A` are returning results similar to this:

```
$ dig MX ntfy.sh +short 
10 mx1.ntfy.sh.
$ dig A mx1.ntfy.sh +short 
3.139.215.220
```

## Behind a proxy (TLS, etc.)
!!! warning
    If you are running ntfy behind a proxy, you must set the `behind-proxy` flag. Otherwise, all visitors are
    [rate limited](#rate-limiting) as if they are one.

It may be desirable to run ntfy behind a proxy (e.g. nginx, HAproxy or Apache), so you can provide TLS certificates 
using Let's Encrypt using certbot, or simply because you'd like to share the ports (80/443) with other services. 
Whatever your reasons may be, there are a few things to consider. 

If you are running ntfy behind a proxy, you should set the `behind-proxy` flag. This will instruct the 
[rate limiting](#rate-limiting) logic to use the `X-Forwarded-For` header as the primary identifier for a visitor, 
as opposed to the remote IP address. If the `behind-proxy` flag is not set, all visitors will
be counted as one, because from the perspective of the ntfy server, they all share the proxy's IP address.

=== "/etc/ntfy/server.yml"
    ``` yaml
    # Tell ntfy to use "X-Forwarded-For" to identify visitors
    behind-proxy: true
    ```

### TLS/SSL
ntfy supports HTTPS/TLS by setting the `listen-https` [config option](#config-options). However, if you 
are behind a proxy, it is recommended that TLS/SSL termination is done by the proxy itself (see below).

I highly recommend using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). I use it with the [dns-route53 plugin](https://certbot-dns-route53.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), 
which lets you use [AWS Route 53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) as the challenge. That's much easier than using the
HTTP challenge. I've found [this guide](https://nandovieira.com/using-lets-encrypt-in-development-with-nginx-and-aws-route53) to
be incredibly helpful.

### nginx/Apache2/caddy
For your convenience, here's a working config that'll help configure things behind a proxy. Be sure to **enable WebSockets**
by forwarding the `Connection` and `Upgrade` headers accordingly. 

In this example, ntfy runs on `:2586` and we proxy traffic to it. We also redirect HTTP to HTTPS for GET requests against a topic
or the root domain:

=== "nginx (/etc/nginx/sites-*/ntfy)"
    ```
    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name ntfy.sh;

      location / {
        # Redirect HTTP to HTTPS, but only for GET topic addresses, since we want 
        # it to work with curl without the annoying https:// prefix
        set $redirect_https "";
        if ($request_method = GET) {
          set $redirect_https "yes";
        }
        if ($request_uri ~* "^/([-_a-z0-9]{0,64}$|docs/|static/)") {
          set $redirect_https "${redirect_https}yes";
        }
        if ($redirect_https = "yesyes") {
          return 302 https://$http_host$request_uri$is_args$query_string;
        }

## Firebase (FCM)
!!! info
    Using Firebase is **optional** and only works if you modify and [build your own Android .apk](develop.md#android-app).
    For a self-hosted instance, it's easier to just not bother with FCM.

[Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) is the Google approved way to send
push messages to Android devices. FCM is the only method that an Android app can receive messages without having to run a
[foreground service](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services).

For the main host [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh), the [ntfy Android app](subscribe/phone.md) uses Firebase to send messages
to the device. For other hosts, instant delivery is used and FCM is not involved.

To configure FCM for your self-hosted instance of the ntfy server, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for a [Firebase account](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a Firebase app and download the key file (e.g. `myapp-firebase-adminsdk-...json`)
3. Place the key file in `/etc/ntfy`, set the `firebase-key-file` in `server.yml` accordingly and restart the ntfy server
4. Build your own Android .apk following [these instructions](develop.md#android-app)

Example:
```
# If set, also publish messages to a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) topic for your app.
# This is optional and only required to support Android apps (which don't allow background services anymore).
#
firebase-key-file: "/etc/ntfy/ntfy-sh-firebase-adminsdk-ahnce-9f4d6f14b5.json"
```

## iOS instant notifications
Unlike Android, iOS heavily restricts background processing, which sadly makes it impossible to implement instant 
push notifications without a central server. 

To still support instant notifications on iOS through your self-hosted ntfy server, you have to forward so called `poll_request` 
messages to the main ntfy.sh server (or any upstream server that's APNS/Firebase connected, if you build your own iOS app),
which will then forward it to Firebase/APNS.

To configure it, simply set `upstream-base-url` like so:

``` yaml
upstream-base-url: "https://ntfy.sh"
```

If set, all incoming messages will publish a poll request to the configured upstream server, containing
the message ID of the original message, instructing the iOS app to poll this server for the actual message contents.

If `upstream-base-url` is not set, notifications will still eventually get to your device, but delivery can take hours,
depending on the state of the phone. If you are using your phone, it shouldn't take more than 20-30 minutes though.

In case you're curious, here's an example of the entire flow: 

- In the iOS app, you subscribe to `https://ntfy.example.com/mytopic`
- The app subscribes to the Firebase topic `6de73be8dfb7d69e...` (the SHA256 of the topic URL)
- When you publish a message to `https://ntfy.example.com/mytopic`, your ntfy server will publish a 
  poll request to `https://ntfy.sh/6de73be8dfb7d69e...`. The request from your server to the upstream server 
  contains only the message ID (in the `X-Poll-ID` header), and the SHA256 checksum of the topic URL (as upstream topic).
- The ntfy.sh server publishes the poll request message to Firebase, which forwards it to APNS, which forwards it to your iOS device
- Your iOS device receives the poll request, and fetches the actual message from your server, and then displays it

Here's an example of what the self-hosted server forwards to the upstream server. The request is equivalent to this curl:

```
curl -X POST -H "X-Poll-ID: s4PdJozxM8na" https://ntfy.sh/6de73be8dfb7d69e32fb2c00c23fe7adbd8b5504406e3068c273aa24cef4055b
{"id":"4HsClFEuCIcs","time":1654087955,"event":"poll_request","topic":"6de73be8dfb7d69e32fb2c00c23fe7adbd8b5504406e3068c273aa24cef4055b","message":"New message","poll_id":"s4PdJozxM8na"}
```

## Rate limiting
!!! info
    Be aware that if you are running ntfy behind a proxy, you must set the `behind-proxy` flag. 
    Otherwise, all visitors are rate limited as if they are one.

By default, ntfy runs without authentication, so it is vitally important that we protect the server from abuse or overload.
There are various limits and rate limits in place that you can use to configure the server:

* **Global limit**: A global limit applies across all visitors (IPs, clients, users)
* **Visitor limit**: A visitor limit only applies to a certain visitor. A **visitor** is identified by its IP address 
  (or the `X-Forwarded-For` header if `behind-proxy` is set). All config options that start with the word `visitor` apply 
  only on a per-visitor basis.

During normal usage, you shouldn't encounter these limits at all, and even if you burst a few requests or emails
(e.g. when you reconnect after a connection drop), it shouldn't have any effect.

### General limits
Let's do the easy limits first:

* `global-topic-limit` defines the total number of topics before the server rejects new topics. It defaults to 15,000.
* `visitor-subscription-limit` is the number of subscriptions (open connections) per visitor. This value defaults to 30.

### Request limits
In addition to the limits above, there is a requests/second limit per visitor for all sensitive GET/PUT/POST requests.
This limit uses a [token bucket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Token_bucket) (using Go's [rate package](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/time/rate)):

Each visitor has a bucket of 60 requests they can fire against the server (defined by `visitor-request-limit-burst`). 
After the 60, new requests will encounter a `429 Too Many Requests` response. The visitor request bucket is refilled at a rate of one
request every 5s (defined by `visitor-request-limit-replenish`)

* `visitor-request-limit-burst` is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has. This defaults to 60.
* `visitor-request-limit-replenish` is the rate at which the bucket is refilled (one request per x). Defaults to 5s.
* `visitor-request-limit-exempt-hosts` is a comma-separated list of hostnames and IPs to be exempt from request rate 
  limiting; hostnames are resolved at the time the server is started. Defaults to an empty list.
 
### Attachment limits
Aside from the global file size and total attachment cache limits (see [above](#attachments)), there are two relevant 
per-visitor limits:

* `visitor-attachment-total-size-limit` is the total storage limit used for attachments per visitor. It defaults to 100M.
  The per-visitor storage is automatically decreased as attachments expire. External attachments (attached via `X-Attach`, 
  see [publishing docs](publish.md#attachments)) do not count here. 
* `visitor-attachment-daily-bandwidth-limit` is the total daily attachment download/upload bandwidth limit per visitor, 
  including PUT and GET requests. This is to protect your precious bandwidth from abuse, since egress costs money in
  most cloud providers. This defaults to 500M.

### E-mail limits
Similarly to the request limit, there is also an e-mail limit (only relevant if [e-mail notifications](#e-mail-notifications) 
are enabled):

* `visitor-email-limit-burst` is the initial bucket of emails each visitor has. This defaults to 16.
* `visitor-email-limit-replenish` is the rate at which the bucket is refilled (one email per x). Defaults to 1h.

### Firebase limits
If [Firebase is configured](#firebase-fcm), all messages are also published to a Firebase topic (unless `Firebase: no` 
is set). Firebase enforces [its own limits](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/concept-options#topics_throttling)
on how many messages can be published. Unfortunately these limits are a little vague and can change depending on the time 
of day. In practice, I have only ever observed `429 Quota exceeded` responses from Firebase if **too many messages are published to 
the same topic**. 

In ntfy, if Firebase responds with a 429 after publishing to a topic, the visitor (= IP address) who published the message
is **banned from publishing to Firebase for 10 minutes** (not configurable). Because publishing to Firebase happens asynchronously,
there is no indication of the user that this has happened. Non-Firebase subscribers (WebSocket or HTTP stream) are not affected.
After the 10 minutes are up, messages forwarding to Firebase is resumed for this visitor.

If this ever happens, there will be a log message that looks something like this:
```
WARN Firebase quota exceeded (likely for topic), temporarily denying Firebase access to visitor
```

## Tuning for scale
If you're running ntfy for your home server, you probably don't need to worry about scale at all. In its default config,
if it's not behind a proxy, the ntfy server can keep about **as many connections as the open file limit allows**.
This limit is typically called `nofile`. Other than that, RAM and CPU are obviously relevant. You may also want to check
out [this discussion on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/r9u4ee/how_many_actively_connected_http_clients_can_a_go/).

Depending on *how you run it*, here are a few limits that are relevant:

### WAL for message cache
By default, the [message cache](#message-cache) (defined by `cache-file`) uses the SQLite default settings, which means it
syncs to disk on every write. For personal servers, this is perfectly adequate. For larger installations, such as ntfy.sh,
the [write-ahead log (WAL)](https://sqlite.org/wal.html) should be enabled, and the sync mode should be adjusted. 
See [this article](https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2020/sqlite-performance-tuning/) for details.

Here's how ntfy.sh has been tuned in the `server.yml` file:

``` yaml
cache-startup-queries: |
    pragma journal_mode = WAL;
    pragma synchronous = normal;
    pragma temp_store = memory;
```

### For systemd services
If you're running ntfy in a systemd service (e.g. for .deb/.rpm packages), the main limiting factor is the
`LimitNOFILE` setting in the systemd unit. The default open files limit for `ntfy.service` is 10,000. You can override it
by creating a `/etc/systemd/system/ntfy.service.d/override.conf` file. As far as I can tell, `/etc/security/limits.conf`
is not relevant.

=== "/etc/systemd/system/ntfy.service.d/override.conf"
    ```
    # Allow 20,000 ntfy connections (and give room for other file handles)
    [Service]
    LimitNOFILE=20500
    ```

### Outside of systemd
If you're running outside systemd, you may want to adjust your `/etc/security/limits.conf` file to
increase the `nofile` setting. Here's an example that increases the limit to 5,000. You can find out the current setting
by running `ulimit -n`, or manually override it temporarily by running `ulimit -n 50000`.

=== "/etc/security/limits.conf"
    ```
    # Increase open files limit globally
    * hard nofile 20500
    ```

### Proxy limits (nginx, Apache2)
If you are running [behind a proxy](#behind-a-proxy-tls-etc) (e.g. nginx, Apache), the open files limit of the proxy is also
relevant. So if your proxy runs inside of systemd, increase the limits in systemd for the proxy. Typically, the proxy
open files limit has to be **double the number of how many connections you'd like to support**, because the proxy has
to maintain the client connection and the connection to ntfy.

=== "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
    ```
    events {
      # Allow 40,000 proxy connections (2x of the desired ntfy connection count;
      # and give room for other file handles)
      worker_connections 40500;
    }
    ```

=== "/etc/systemd/system/nginx.service.d/override.conf"
    ```
    # Allow 40,000 proxy connections (2x of the desired ntfy connection count;
    # and give room for other file handles)
    [Service]
    LimitNOFILE=40500
    ```

### Banning bad actors (fail2ban)
If you put stuff on the Internet, bad actors will try to break them or break in. [fail2ban](https://www.fail2ban.org/)
and nginx's [ngx_http_limit_req_module module](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_limit_req_module.html) can be used
to ban client IPs if they misbehave. This is on top of the [rate limiting](#rate-limiting) inside the ntfy server.

Here's an example for how ntfy.sh is configured, following the instructions from two tutorials ([here](https://easyengine.io/tutorials/nginx/fail2ban/) 
and [here](https://easyengine.io/tutorials/nginx/block-wp-login-php-bruteforce-attack/)):

=== "/etc/nginx/nginx.conf"
    ```
    http {
	  limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=1r/s;
    }
    ```

=== "/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ntfy.sh"
    ```
    # For each server/location block
    server {
      location / {
        limit_req zone=one burst=1000 nodelay;
      }
    }    
    ```

=== "/etc/fail2ban/filter.d/nginx-req-limit.conf"
    ```
    [Definition]
    failregex = limiting requests, excess:.* by zone.*client: <HOST>
    ignoreregex =
    ```

=== "/etc/fail2ban/jail.local"
    ```
    [nginx-req-limit]
    enabled = true
    filter = nginx-req-limit
    action = iptables-multiport[name=ReqLimit, port="http,https", protocol=tcp]
    logpath = /var/log/nginx/error.log
    findtime = 600
    bantime = 7200
    maxretry = 10
    ```

## Debugging/tracing
If something's not working right, you can debug/trace through what the ntfy server is doing by setting the `log-level`
to `DEBUG` or `TRACE`. The `DEBUG` setting will output information about each published message, but not the message 
contents. The `TRACE` setting will also print the message contents. 

!!! warning
    Both options are very verbose and should only be enabled in production for short periods of time. Otherwise, 
    you're going to run out of disk space pretty quickly.

You can also hot-reload the `log-level` by sending the `SIGHUP` signal to the process after editing the `server.yml` file.
You can do so by calling `systemctl reload ntfy` (if ntfy is running inside systemd), or by calling `kill -HUP $(pidof ntfy)`. 
If successful, you'll see something like this:

```
$ ntfy serve
2022/06/02 10:29:28 INFO Listening on :2586[http] :1025[smtp], log level is INFO
2022/06/02 10:29:34 INFO Partially hot reloading configuration ...
2022/06/02 10:29:34 INFO Log level is TRACE
```

## Config options
Each config option can be set in the config file `/etc/ntfy/server.yml` (e.g. `listen-http: :80`) or as a
CLI option (e.g. `--listen-http :80`. Here's a list of all available options. Alternatively, you can set an environment
variable before running the `ntfy` command (e.g. `export NTFY_LISTEN_HTTP=:80`).

!!! info
    All config options can also be defined in the `server.yml` file using underscores instead of dashes, e.g. 
    `cache_duration` and `cache-duration` are both supported. This is to support stricter YAML parsers that do 
    not support dashes.

| Config option                              | Env variable                                    | Format                                              | Default           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
