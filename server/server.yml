# ntfy server config file
#
# Please refer to the documentation at https://ntfy.sh/docs/config/ for details.
# All options also support underscores (_) instead of dashes (-) to comply with the YAML spec.

# Public facing base URL of the service (e.g. https://ntfy.sh or https://ntfy.example.com)
#
# This setting is required for any of the following features:
# - attachments (to return a download URL)
# - e-mail sending (for the topic URL in the email footer)
# - iOS push notifications for self-hosted servers (to calculate the Firebase poll_request topic)
# - Matrix Push Gateway (to validate that the pushkey is correct)
#
# base-url:

# Listen address for the HTTP & HTTPS web server. If "listen-https" is set, you must also
# set "key-file" and "cert-file". Format: [<ip>]:<port>, e.g. "1.2.3.4:8080".
#
# To listen on all interfaces, you may omit the IP address, e.g. ":443".
# To disable HTTP, set "listen-http" to "-".
#
# listen-http: ":80"
# listen-https:

# Listen on a Unix socket, e.g. /var/lib/ntfy/ntfy.sock
# This can be useful to avoid port issues on local systems, and to simplify permissions.
#
# listen-unix: <socket-path>
# listen-unix-mode: <linux permissions, e.g. 0700>

# Path to the private key & cert file for the HTTPS web server. Not used if "listen-https" is not set.
#
# key-file: <filename>
# cert-file: <filename>

# If set, also publish messages to a Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) topic for your app.
# This is optional and only required to save battery when using the Android app.
#
# firebase-key-file: <filename>

# If "cache-file" is set, messages are cached in a local SQLite database instead of only in-memory.
# This allows for service restarts without losing messages in support of the since= parameter.
#
# The "cache-duration" parameter defines the duration for which messages will be buffered
# before they are deleted. This is required to support the "since=..." and "poll=1" parameter.
# To disable the cache entirely (on-disk/in-memory), set "cache-duration" to 0.
# The cache file is created automatically, provided that the correct permissions are set.
#
# The "cache-startup-queries" parameter allows you to run commands when the database is initialized,
# e.g. to enable WAL mode (see https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2020/sqlite-performance-tuning/)).
# Example:
#    cache-startup-queries: |
#       pragma journal_mode = WAL;
#       pragma synchronous = normal;
#       pragma temp_store = memory;
#
# Debian/RPM package users:
#   Use /var/cache/ntfy/cache.db as cache file to avoid permission issues. The package
#   creates this folder for you.
#
# Check your permissions:
#   If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this cache file is owned by the
#   ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.
#
# cache-file: <filename>
# cache-duration: "12h"
# cache-startup-queries:

# If set, access to the ntfy server and API can be controlled on a granular level using
# the 'ntfy user' and 'ntfy access' commands. See the --help pages for details, or check the docs.
#
# - auth-file is the SQLite user/access database; it is created automatically if it doesn't already exist
# - auth-default-access defines the default/fallback access if no access control entry is found; it can be
#   set to "read-write" (default), "read-only", "write-only" or "deny-all".
#
# Debian/RPM package users:
#   Use /var/lib/ntfy/user.db as user database to avoid permission issues. The package
#   creates this folder for you.
#
# Check your permissions:
#   If you are running ntfy with systemd, make sure this user database file is owned by the
#   ntfy user and group by running: chown ntfy.ntfy <filename>.
#
# auth-file: <filename>
# auth-default-access: "read-write"

# If set, the X-Forwarded-For header is used to determine the visitor IP address
# instead of the remote address of the connection.
#
# WARNING: If you are behind a proxy, you must set this, otherwise all visitors are rate limited
#          as if they are one.
#
# behind-proxy: false

# If enabled, clients can attach files to notifications as attachments. Minimum settings to enable attachments
# are "attachment-cache-dir" and "base-url".
#
# - attachment-cache-dir is the cache directory for attached files
# - attachment-total-size-limit is the limit of the on-disk attachment cache directory (total size)
# - attachment-file-size-limit is the per-file attachment size limit (e.g. 300k, 2M, 100M)
# - attachment-expiry-duration is the duration after which uploaded attachments will be deleted (e.g. 3h, 20h)
#
# attachment-cache-dir:
# attachment-total-size-limit: "5G"
# attachment-file-size-limit: "15M"
# attachment-expiry-duration: "3h"

# If enabled, allow outgoing e-mail notifications via the 'X-Email' header. If this header is set,
# messages will additionally be sent out as e-mail using an external SMTP server. As of today, only
# SMTP servers with plain text auth and STARTLS are supported. Please also refer to the rate limiting settings
# below (visitor-email-limit-burst & visitor-email-limit-burst).
#
# - smtp-sender-addr is the hostname:port of the SMTP server
# - smtp-sender-user/smtp-sender-pass are the username and password of the SMTP user
# - smtp-sender-from is the e-mail address of the sender
#
# smtp-sender-addr:
# smtp-sender-user:
# smtp-sender-pass:
# smtp-sender-from:

# If enabled, ntfy will launch a lightweight SMTP server for incoming messages. Once configured, users can send
# emails to a topic e-mail address to publish messages to a topic.
#
# - smtp-server-listen defines the IP address and port the SMTP server will listen on, e.g. :25 or 1.2.3.4:25
# - smtp-server-domain is the e-mail domain, e.g. ntfy.sh
# - smtp-server-addr-prefix is an optional prefix for the e-mail addresses to prevent spam. If set to "ntfy-",
#   for instance, only e-mails to ntfy-$topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted. If this is not set, all emails to
#   $topic@ntfy.sh will be accepted (which may obviously be a spam problem).

# smtp-server-listen:
# smtp-server-domain:
# smtp-server-addr-prefix:

# Interval in which keepalive messages are sent to the client. This is to prevent
# intermediaries closing the connection for inactivity.
#
# Note that the Android app has a hardcoded timeout at 77s, so it should be less than that.
#
# keepalive-interval: "45s"

# Interval in which the manager prunes old messages, deletes topics
# and prints the stats.
#
# manager-interval: "1m"

# Defines if the root route (/) is pointing to the landing page (as on ntfy.sh) or the
# web app. If you self-host, you don't want to change this.
# Can be "app" (default), "home" or "disable" to disable the web app entirely.
#
# web-root: app

# Server URL of a Firebase/APNS-connected ntfy server (likely "https://ntfy.sh").
#
# iOS users:
#   If you use the iOS ntfy app, you MUST configure this to receive timely notifications. You'll like want this:
#   upstream-base-url: "https://ntfy.sh"
#
# If set, all incoming messages will publish a "poll_request" message to the configured upstream server, containing
# the message ID of the original message, instructing the iOS app to poll this server for the actual message contents.
# This is to prevent the upstream server and Firebase/APNS from being able to read the message.
#
# upstream-base-url:

# Rate limiting: Total number of topics before the server rejects new topics.
#
# global-topic-limit: 15000

#
# visitor-subscription-limit: 30

# Rate limiting: Allowed GET/PUT/POST requests per second, per visitor:
# - visitor-request-limit-burst is the initial bucket of requests each visitor has
# - visitor-request-limit-replenish is the rate at which the bucket is refilled
# - visitor-request-limit-exempt-hosts is a comma-separated list of hostnames, IPs or CIDRs to be
#   exempt from request rate limiting. Hostnames are resolved at the time the server is started.
#   Example: "1.2.3.4,ntfy.example.com,8.7.6.0/24"
#
# visitor-request-limit-burst: 60
# visitor-request-limit-replenish: "5s"
# visitor-request-limit-exempt-hosts: ""

# Log level, can be TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN or ERROR
# This option can be hot-reloaded by calling "kill -HUP $pid" or "systemctl reload ntfy".
#
# Be aware that DEBUG (and particularly TRACE) can be VERY CHATTY. Only turn them on for
# debugging purposes, or your disk will fill up quickly.
