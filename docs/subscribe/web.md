# Subscribe from the Web UI
You can use the Web UI to subscribe to topics as well. If you do, and you keep the website open, **notifications will
pop up as desktop notifications**. Simply type in the topic name and click the *Subscribe* button. The browser will 
keep a connection open and listen for incoming notifications.

To learn how to send messages, check out the [publishing page](../publish.md).

<div id="web-screenshots" class="screenshots">
    <a href="../../static/img/web-detail.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-detail.png"/></a> 
    <a href="../../static/img/web-notification.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-notification.png"/></a>
    <a href="../../static/img/web-subscribe.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-subscribe.png"/></a>
</div>

To keep receiving desktop notifications from ntfy, you need to keep the website open. What I do, and what I highly recommend,
is to pin the tab so that it's always open, but sort of out of the way:

<figure markdown>
  ![pinned](../static/img/web-pin.png){ width=500 }
  <figcaption>Pin web app to move it out of the way</figcaption>
</figure>
