### ntfy server v2.11.0
Released May 13, 2024

This is a tiny release that fixes a database index issue that caused performance issues on ntfy.sh. It also fixes a bug
in the rate visitor logic that caused rate visitors to be assigned to seemingly random topics. Nothing major this time.

‚ù§Ô∏è Quick reminder that if you like ntfy, **please consider sponsoring us** via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier)
and [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/ntfy/), or buying a [paid plan via the web app](https://ntfy.sh/app). ntfy will always remain open source.

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Re-add database index `idx_topic` to the `messages` table to fix performance issues on ntfy.sh (no ticket, big thanks to [@tcaputi](https://github.com/tcaputi) for finding this issue)
* Do not set rate visitor for non-eligible topics (no ticket)
* Do not cache `config.js` ([#1098](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1098), thanks to [@wunter8](https://github.com/wunter8))

### ntfy server v2.10.0
Released Mar 27, 2024

This release adds support for **message templating** in the ntfy server, which allows you to include a message and/or
title template that will be filled with values from a JSON body (e.g. `curl -gd '{"alert":"Disk space low"}' "ntfy.sh/mytopic?tpl=1&m={{.alert}}"`).
This is great for services that let you specify a webhook URL but do not let you change the webhook body (such as GitHub, or Grafana).

**Features:**

* [Message templating](publish.md#message-templating): You can now include a message and/or title template that will be filled with values from a JSON body ([#724](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/724), thanks to [@wunter8](https://github.com/wunter8) for implementing)

### ntfy server v2.9.0
Released Mar 7, 2024

A small release after a long pause (lots of day job work). This release adds for **larger messages** and **longer
message delays** in scheduled delivery messages. The web app also now supports pasting images from the clipboard. Other
than that, only a few bug fixes and documentation updates, and a teeny tiny breaking change üò¨.

!!! info
    ‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking change**: The `Rate-Topics` header was removed due to a [DoS issue](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/1048). This only affects
    installations with `visitor-subscriber-rate-limiting: true`, which is not the default and likely very rarely used.
    Normally I'd never remove a feature, but this is a security issue, and likely affects almost nobody.

**Features:**

* Support for larger message delays with `message-delay-limit` (see [message limits](config.md#message-limits), [#1050](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1050)/[#1019](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/1019), thanks to [@MrChadMWood](https://github.com/MrChadMWood) for reporting)
* Support for larger message body sizes with `message-size-limit` (use at your own risk, see [message limits](config.md#message-limits), [#836](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/836)/[#1050](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1050), thanks to [@zhzy0077](https://github.com/zhzy0077) for implementing this, and to [@nkjshlsqja7331](https://github.com/nkjshlsqja7331) for reporting)
* Web app: You can now paste images into the message bar or publish dialog ([#963](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/963)/[#572](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/572), thanks to [@cmj2002](https://github.com/cmj2002) for implementing, and [@rounakdatta](https://github.com/rounakdatta) for reporting)

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Remove `Rate-Topics` header due to DoS security issue if `visitor-subscriber-rate-limiting: true` ([#1048](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/1048))

**Documentation:**

* Remove `mkdocs-simple-hooks` ([#1016](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1016), thanks to [@Tom-Hubrecht](https://github.com/Tom-Hubrecht))
* Update Watchtower example ([#1014](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1014), thanks to [@lennart-m](https://github.com/lennart-m))
* Fix dead links ([#1022](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1022), thanks to [@DerRockWolf](https://github.com/DerRockWolf))
* PowerShell file upload example ([#1004](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/1004), thanks to [@YMan84](https://github.com/YMan84))

## ntfy iOS app v1.3
Released Nov 26, 2023

This release (hopefully) fixes the issues with the iOS UI not updating properly when new notifications arrive, as well
as notifications not being received (anymore) after previously working. Both issues have been annoying and known bugs
for a long time, and I hope that they are finally fixed. 

Many thanks to [@tcaputi](https://github.com/tcaputi) for fixing the issues, and to the anonymous donor for sponsoring these fixes.

**Bug fixes:**

* UI not updating properly ([#267](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/267)/[#402](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/402), thanks to [@tcaputi](https://github.com/tcaputi))

## ntfy server v2.8.0
Released November 19, 2023

This release brings a handful of random bug fixes: two unrelated access control list fixes, a fix around web app crashes
for languages with underscores in the language code (e.g. `zh_Hant`, `zh_Hans`, `pt_BR`, ...), a workaround for the
`Priority` header (often used in Cloudflare setups), and support among others support for HTML-only emails (finally),
web app crash fixes

## ntfy server v2.7.0
Released August 17, 2023

This release ships Markdown support for the web app (not in the Android app yet), and adds support for 
right-to-left languages (RTL) in the web app. It also fixes a few issues around date/time formatting, 
internationalization support, a CLI auth bug.

Furthermore, it fixes a security issue around access tokens getting erroneously deleted for other users
in a specific scenario. This was a denial-of-service-type security issue, since it **effectively allowed a
single user to deny access to all other users of a ntfy instance**. Please note that while tokens were
erroneously deleted, **nobody but the token owner ever had access to it.** Please refer to [the ticket](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/838)
for details. **Please upgrade your ntfy instance if you run a multi-user system.**

**Features:**

* Add support for [Markdown formatting](publish.md#markdown-formatting) in web app ([#310](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/310), thanks to [@nihalgonsalves](https://github.com/nihalgonsalves))
* Add support for right-to-left languages (RTL) in the web app ([#663](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/663), thanks to [@nimbleghost](https://github.com/nimbleghost))

**Security:** ‚ö†Ô∏è

* Fixes issue with access tokens getting deleted ([#838](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/838))

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Re-init i18n on each service worker message to avoid missing translations ([#817](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/817), thanks to [@nihalgonsalves](https://github.com/nihalgonsalves))
* You can now unset the default user:pass/token in `client.yml` for an individual subscription to remove the Authorization header ([#829](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/829), thanks to [@tomeon](https://github.com/tomeon) for reporting and to [@wunter8](https://github.com/wunter8) for fixing)

**Documentation:**

* Update docs for Apache config ([#819](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/819), thanks to [@nisbet-hubbard](https://github.com/nisbet-hubbard))

## ntfy server v2.6.2
Released June 30, 2023

With this release, the ntfy web app now contains a **[progressive web app](subscribe/pwa.md) (PWA)
with Web Push support**, which means you'll be able to **install the ntfy web app on your desktop or phone** similar 
to a native app (__even on iOS!__ ü•≥). Installing the PWA gives ntfy web its own launcher, a standalone window, 
push notifications, and an app badge with the unread notification count. Note that for self-hosted servers, 
[Web Push](config.md#web-push) must be configured.

On top of that, this release also brings **dark mode** üßõüåô to the web app.

üôè A huge thanks for this release goes to [@nimbleghost](https://github.com/nimbleghost), for basically implementing the 
Web Push / PWA and dark mode feature by himself. I'm really grateful for your contributions.

‚ù§Ô∏è If you like ntfy, **please consider sponsoring us** via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier)
and [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/ntfy/), or buying a [paid plan via the web app](https://ntfy.sh/app) (20% off
if you use promo code `MYTOPIC`). ntfy will always remain open source.

**Features:**

* The web app now supports Web Push, and is installable as a [progressive web app (PWA)](https://docs.ntfy.sh/subscribe/pwa/) on Chrome, Edge, Android, and iOS ([#751](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/751), thanks to [@nimbleghost](https://github.com/nimbleghost))
* Support for dark mode in the web app ([#206](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/206), thanks to [@nimbleghost](https://github.com/nimbleghost))

**Bug fixes:**

* Support encoding any header as RFC 2047 ([#737](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/737), thanks to [@cfouche3005](https://github.com/cfouche3005) for reporting)
* Do not forward poll requests for UnifiedPush messages (no ticket, thanks to NoName for reporting)
* Fix `ntfy pub %` segfaulting ([#760](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/760), thanks to [@clesmian](https://github.com/clesmian) for reporting)

**Changes in tarball/zip naming:**   
Due to a [change in GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/deprecations/#archivesreplacements), some of the binary release 
archives now have slightly different names. My apologies if this causes issues in the downstream projects that use ntfy:

- `ntfy_v${VERSION}_windows_x86_64.zip` -> `ntfy_v${VERSION}_windows_amd64.zip`
- `ntfy_v${VERSION}_linux_x86_64.tar.gz` -> `ntfy_v${VERSION}_linux_amd64.tar.gz`
- `ntfy_v${VERSION}_macOS_all.tar.gz` -> `ntfy_v${VERSION}_darwin_all.tar.gz`

This release disables server-initiated polling of iOS devices entirely, thereby eliminating the thundering herd problem
on ntfy.sh that we observe every 20 minutes. The polling was never strictly necessary, and has actually caused duplicate
delivery issues as well, so disabling it should not have any negative effects. iOS users, please reach out via Discord
or Matrix if there are issues.

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Disable iOS polling entirely ([#677](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/677)/[#509](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/509))

## ntfy server v2.3.0
Released March 29, 2023

This release primarily fixes an issue with delayed messages, and it adds support for Go's profiler (if enabled), which
will allow investigating usage spikes in more detail. There will likely be a follow-up release this week to fix the
actual spikes [caused by iOS devices](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/677).

**Features:**

* ntfy now supports Go's `pprof` profiler, if enabled (relates to [#677](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/677))

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Fix delayed message sending from authenticated users ([#679](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/679))
* Fixed plural for Polish and other translations ([#678](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/678), thanks to [@bmoczulski](https://github.com/bmoczulski))

## ntfy server v2.2.0
Released March 17, 2023

With this release, ntfy is now able to expose metrics via a `/metrics` endpoint for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), if enabled.
The endpoint exposes about 20 different counters and gauges, from the number of published messages and emails, to active subscribers,
visitors and topics. If you'd like more metrics, pop in the Discord/Matrix or file an issue on GitHub. 

On top of this, you can now use access tokens in the ntfy CLI (defined in the `client.yml` file), fixed a bug in `ntfy subscribe`,
removed the dependency on Google Fonts, and more.

üî• Reminder: Purchase one of three **ntfy Pro plans** for **50% off** for a limited time (if you use promo code `MYTOPIC`). 
ntfy Pro gives you higher rate limits and lets you reserve topic names. [Buy through web app](https://ntfy.sh/app).

‚ù§Ô∏è If you don't need ntfy Pro, please consider sponsoring ntfy via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier)
and [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/ntfy/). ntfy will stay open source forever.

**Features:**

* Monitoring: ntfy now exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) if [configured](config.md#monitoring) ([#210](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/210), thanks to [@rogeliodh](https://github.com/rogeliodh) for reporting)
* You can now use tokens in `client.yml` for publishing and subscribing ([#653](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/653), thanks to [@wunter8](https://github.com/wunter8))

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* `ntfy sub --poll --from-config` will now include authentication headers from client.yml (if applicable) ([#658](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/658), thanks to [@wunter8](https://github.com/wunter8))
* Docs: Removed dependency on Google Fonts in docs ([#554](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/554), thanks to [@bt90](https://github.com/bt90) for reporting, and [@ozskywalker](https://github.com/ozskywalker) for implementing)
* Increase allowed auth failure attempts per IP address to 30 (no ticket)
* Web app: Increase maximum incremental backoff retry interval to 2 minutes (no ticket)

**Documentation:**

* Make query parameter description more clear ([#630](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/630), thanks to [@bbaa-bbaa](https://github.com/bbaa-bbaa) for reporting, and to [@wunter8](https://github.com/wunter8) for a fix)

## ntfy server v2.1.2
Released March 4, 2023

This is a hotfix release, mostly to combat the ridiculous amount of Matrix requests with invalid/dead pushkeys, and the
corresponding HTTP 507 responses the ntfy.sh server is sending out. We're up to >600k HTTP 507 responses per day ü§¶. This 
release solves this issue by rejecting Matrix pushkeys, if nobody has subscribed to the corresponding topic for 12 hours.

The release furthermore reverts the default rate limiting behavior for UnifiedPush to be publisher-based, and introduces
a flag to enable [subscriber-based rate limiting](config.md#subscriber-based-rate-limiting) for high volume servers.

**Features:**

* Support SMTP servers without auth ([#645](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/645), thanks to [@Sharknoon](https://github.com/Sharknoon) for reporting)

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Token auth doesn't work if default user credentials are defined in `client.yml` ([#650](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/650), thanks to [@Xinayder](https://github.com/Xinayder))
* Add `visitor-subscriber-rate-limiting` flag to allow enabling [subscriber-based rate limiting](config.md#subscriber-based-rate-limiting) (off by default now, [#649](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/649)/[#655](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/655), thanks to [@barathrm](https://github.com/barathrm) for reporting, and to [@karmanyaahm](https://github.com/karmanyaahm) and [@p1gp1g](https://github.com/p1gp1g) for help with the design)
* Reject Matrix pushkey after 12 hours of inactivity on a topic, if `visitor-subscriber-rate-limiting` is enabled ([#643](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/643), thanks to [@karmanyaahm](https://github.com/karmanyaahm) and [@p1gp1g](https://github.com/p1gp1g) for help with the design)  

**Additional languages:**

* Danish (thanks to [@Andersbiha](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/Andersbiha/))

## ntfy server v2.1.1
Released March 1, 2023

This is a tiny release with a few bug fixes, but it's big for me personally. After almost three months of work, 
**today I am finally launching the paid plans on ntfy.sh** ü•≥ üéâ. 

You are now able to purchase one of three plans that'll give you **higher rate limits** (messages, emails, attachment sizes, ...), 
as well as the ability to **reserve topic names** for your personal use, while at the same time supporting me and the
ntfy open source project ‚ù§Ô∏è. You can check out the pricing, and [purchase plans through the web app](https://ntfy.sh/app) (use
promo code `MYTOPIC` for a **50% discount**, limited time only).

And as I've said many times: Do not worry. **ntfy will always stay open source**, and that includes all features. There
are no closed-source features. So if you'd like to run your own server, you can!

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Fix panic when using Firebase without users ([#641](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/641), thanks to [u/heavybell](https://www.reddit.com/user/heavybell/) for reporting)
* Remove health check from `Dockerfile` and [document it](config.md#health-checks) ([#635](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/635), thanks to [@Andersbiha](https://github.com/Andersbiha)) 
* Upgrade dialog: Disable submit button for free tier (no ticket)
* Allow multiple `log-level-overrides` on the same field (no ticket)
* Actually remove `ntfy publish --env-topic` flag (as per [deprecations](deprecations.md), no ticket)
* Added `billing-contact` config option (no ticket)

## ntfy server v2.1.0
Released February 25, 2023

This release changes the way UnifiedPush (UP) topics are rate limited from publisher-based rate limiting to subscriber-based
rate limiting. This allows UP application servers to send higher volumes, since the subscribers carry the rate limits.
However, it also means that UP clients have to subscribe to a topic first before they are allowed to publish. If they do
no, clients will receive an HTTP 507 response from the server.

We also fixed another issue with UnifiedPush: Some Mastodon servers were sending unsupported `Authorization` headers, 
which ntfy rejected with an HTTP 401. We now ignore unsupported header values. 

As of this release, ntfy also supports sending emails to protected topics, and it ships code to support annual billing
cycles (not live yet).

As part of this release, I also enabled sign-up and login (free accounts only), and I also started reducing the rate 
limits for anonymous & free users a bit. With the next release and the launch of the paid plan, I'll reduce the limits
a bit more. For 90% of users, you should not feel the difference.

**Features:**

* UnifiedPush: Subscriber-based rate limiting for `up*` topics ([#584](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/584)/[#609](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/609)/[#633](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/633), thanks to [@karmanyaahm](https://github.com/karmanyaahm))
* Support for publishing to protected topics via email with access tokens ([#612](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/621), thanks to [@tamcore](https://github.com/tamcore))
* Support for base64-encoded and nested multipart emails ([#610](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/610), thanks to [@Robert-litts](https://github.com/Robert-litts))
* Payments: Add support for annual billing intervals (no ticket)

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Web: Do not disable "Reserve topic" checkbox for admins (no ticket, thanks to @xenrox for reporting)
* UnifiedPush: Treat non-Basic/Bearer `Authorization` header like header was not sent ([#629](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/629), thanks to [@Boebbele](https://github.com/Boebbele) and [@S1m](https://github.com/S1m) for reporting)

**Documentation:**

* Added example for [Traccar](https://ntfy.sh/docs/examples/#traccar) ([#631](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/631), thanks to [tamcore](https://github.com/tamcore))

**Additional languages:**

* Arabic (thanks to [@ButterflyOfFire](https://hosted.weblate.org/user/ButterflyOfFire/))

## ntfy server v2.0.1
Released February 17, 2023

This is a quick bugfix release to address a panic that happens when `attachment-cache-dir` is not set.

**Bug fixes + maintenance:**

* Avoid panic in manager when `attachment-cache-dir` is not set ([#617](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/617), thanks to [@ksurl](https://github.com/ksurl))  
* Ensure that calls to standard logger `log.Println` also output JSON (no ticket)

## ntfy server v2.0.0
Released February 16, 2023

This is the biggest ntfy server release I've ever done ü•≥ . Lots of new and exciting features. 

**Brand-new features:**

* **User signup/login & account sync**: If enabled, users can now register to create a user account, and then login to 
  the web app. Once logged in, topic subscriptions and user settings are stored server-side in the user account (as 
  opposed to only in the browser storage). So far, this is implemented only in the web app only. Once it's in the Android/iOS
  app, you can easily keep your account in sync. Relevant [config options](config.md#config-options) are `enable-signup` and 
  `enable-login`.
  <div id="account-screenshots" class="screenshots">
    <a href="../../static/img/web-signup.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-signup.png"/></a>
    <a href="../../static/img/web-account.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-account.png"/></a>
  </div>
* **Topic reservations** üéâ: If enabled, users can now **reserve topics and restrict access to other users**.
  Once this is fully rolled out, you may reserve `ntfy.sh/philbackups` and define access so that only you can publish/subscribe
  to the topic. Reservations let you claim ownership of a topic, and you can define access permissions for others as
  `deny-all` (only you have full access), `read-only` (you can publish/subscribe, others can subscribe), `write-only` (you 
  can publish/subscribe, others can publish), `read-write` (everyone can publish/subscribe, but you remain the owner).
  Topic reservations can be [configured](config.md#config-options) in the web app if `enable-reservations` is enabled, and 
  only if the user has a [tier](config.md#tiers) that supports reservations.
  <div id="reserve-screenshots" class="screenshots">
    <a href="../../static/img/web-reserve-topic.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-reserve-topic.png"/></a> 
    <a href="../../static/img/web-reserve-topic-dialog.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-reserve-topic-dialog.png"/></a>
  </div>
* **Access tokens:** It is now possible to create user access tokens for a user account. Access tokens are useful
  to avoid having to paste your password to various applications or scripts. For instance, you may want to use a 
  dedicated token to publish from your backup host, and one from your home automation system. Tokens can be configured
  in the web app, or via the `ntfy token` command. See [creating tokens](config.md#access-tokens),
  and [publishing using tokens](publish.md#access-tokens).
  <div id="token-screenshots" class="screenshots">
    <a href="../../static/img/web-token-create.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-token-create.png"/></a> 
    <a href="../../static/img/web-token-list.png"><img src="../../static/img/web-token-list.png"/></a>
  </div>
* **Structured logging:** I've redone a lot of the logging to make it more structured, and to make it easier to debug and
  troubleshoot. Logs can now be written to a file, and as JSON (if configured). Each log event carries context fields
  that you can filter and search on using tools like `jq`. On top of that, you can override the log level if certain fields
  match. For instance, you can say `user_name=phil -> debug` to log everything related to a certain user with debug level.
  See [logging & debugging](config.md#logging-debugging).
* **Tiers:** You can now define and associate usage tiers to users. Tiers can be used to grant users higher limits, such as
  daily message limits, attachment size, or make it possible for users to reserve topics. You could, for instance, have
  a tier `Standard` that allows 500 messages/day, 15 MB attachments and 5 allowed topic reservations, and another
  tier `Friends & Family` with much higher limits. For ntfy.sh, I'll mostly use these tiers to facilitate paid plans (see below).
  Tiers can be configured via the `ntfy tier ...` command. See [tiers](config.md#tiers).
* **Paid tiers:** Starting very soon, I will be offering paid tiers for ntfy.sh on top of the free service. You'll be
  able to subscribe to tiers with higher rate limits (more daily messages, bigger attachments) and topic reservations.
  Paid tiers are facilitated by integrating [Stripe](https://stripe.com) as a payment provider. See [payments](config.md#payments)
  for details.

**ntfy is forever open source!**   
Yes, I will be offering some paid plans. But you don't need to panic! I won't be taking any features away, and everything 
will remain forever open source, so you can self-host if you like. Similar to the donations via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier)
and [Liberapay](https://en.liberapay.com/ntfy/), paid plans will help pay for the service and keep me motivated to keep
going. It'll only make ntfy better.

**Other tickets:**

* User account signup, login, topic reservations, access tokens, tiers etc. ([#522](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/522))
* `OPTIONS` method calls are not serviced when the UI is disabled ([#598](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/598), thanks to [@enticedwanderer](https://github.com/enticedwanderer) for reporting)

**Special thanks:**

A big Thank-you goes to everyone who tested the user account and payments work. I very much appreciate all the feedback,
suggestions, and bug reports. Thank you, @nwithan8, @deadcade, @xenrox, @cmeis, @wunter8 and the others who I forgot.

## ntfy server v1.31.0
Released February 14, 2023

This is a tiny release before the really big release, and also the last before the big v2.0.0. The most interesting 
things in this release are the new preliminary health endpoint to allow monitoring in K8s (and others), and the removal

## ntfy server v1.30.1
Released December 23, 2022 üéÖ

This is a special holiday edition version of ntfy, with all sorts of holiday fun and games, and hidden quests.
Nahh, just kidding. This release is an intermediate release mainly to eliminate warnings in the logs, so I can
roll out the TLSv1.3, HTTP/2 and Unix mode changes on ntfy.sh (see [#552](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/552)).

## ntfy server v1.29.1
Released November 17, 2022

This is mostly a bugfix release to address the high load on ntfy.sh. There are now two new options that allow
synchronous batch-writing of messages to the cache. This avoids database locking, and subsequent pileups of waiting
requests.

**Bug fixes:**

* High-load servers: Allow asynchronous batch-writing of messages to cache via `cache-batch-*` options ([#498](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/498)/[#502](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/pull/502))

**Other things:**

* Put ntfy.sh docs on GitHub pages to reduce AWS outbound traffic cost ([#491](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/491))
* The ntfy.sh server hardware was upgraded to a bigger box. If you'd like to help out carrying the server cost, **[sponsorships and donations](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier)** üí∏ would be very much appreciated

## ntfy server v1.29.0
Released November 12, 2022

This release adds the ability to add rate limit exemptions for IP ranges instead of just specific IP addresses. It also fixes 
a few bugs in the web app and the CLI and adds lots of new examples and install instructions.

We also got a ton of new **[sponsors and donations](https://github.com/sponsors/binwiederhier)** üí∏, which is amazing. I'd like to thank
all of you for believing in the project, and for helping me pay the server cost. The HN spike increased the AWS cost quite a bit.

production problem with a few over-users that resulted in Firebase quota problems (only applying to the over-users).

On top of that, we updated the Firebase SDK and are now building the release in GitHub Actions. We've also got two

## ntfy iOS app v1.1
Released May 31, 2022

In this release of the iOS app, we add message priorities (mapped to iOS interruption levels), tags and emojis,
action buttons to open websites or perform HTTP requests (in the notification and the detail view), a custom click
action when the notification is tapped, and various other fixes.

It also adds support for self-hosted servers (albeit not supporting auth yet). The self-hosted server needs to be
configured to forward poll requests to upstream ntfy.sh for push notifications to work (see [iOS push notifications](https://ntfy.sh/docs/config/#ios-instant-notifications)
for details).

**Features:**

* [Message priority](https://ntfy.sh/docs/publish/#message-priority) support (no ticket)

**Bug fixes:**

* iOS UI not always updating properly ([#267](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/267))

## ntfy server v1.24.0
Released May 28, 2022

This release of the ntfy server brings supporting features for the ntfy iOS app. Most importantly, it
enables support for self-hosted servers in combination with the iOS app. This is to overcome the restrictive
Apple development environment.

**Features:**

* Regularly send Firebase keepalive messages to ~poll topic to support self-hosted servers (no ticket)
* Add subscribe filter to query exact messages by ID (no ticket)
* Support for `poll_request` messages to support [iOS push notifications](https://ntfy.sh/docs/config/#ios-instant-notifications) for self-hosted servers (no ticket)

**Bug fixes:**

* Support emails without `Content-Type` ([#265](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/265), thanks to [@dmbonsall](https://github.com/dmbonsall))

**Additional translations:**

## ntfy iOS app v1.0
Released May 25, 2022

This is the first version of the ntfy iOS app. It supports only ntfy.sh (no selfhosted servers) and only messages + title
(no priority, tags, attachments, ...). I'll rapidly add (hopefully) most of the other ntfy features, and then I'll focus
on self-hosted servers.

The app is now available in the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ntfy/id1625396347).

**Tickets:**

* iOS app ([#4](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/4), see also: [TestFlight summary](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/4#issuecomment-1133767150))

  some known issues which will be addressed in follow-up releases).

it adds support for APNs, the iOS messaging service. This is needed for the (soon to be released) iOS app.

**Features:**

* [Windows](https://ntfy.sh/docs/install/#windows) and [macOS](https://ntfy.sh/docs/install/#macos) builds for the [ntfy CLI](https://ntfy.sh/docs/subscribe/cli/) ([#112](https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/issues/112))
